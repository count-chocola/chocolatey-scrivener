## Vat?
These files are ~~vat's~~ what's needed to locally package the awesome writing program [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) for use with the [Chocolatey NuGet](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager.

## Vhy?
Because:
- Attended installations on Windows suck _(ah. ah. ahhhâ€¦)_.
- You want to manage your PC using [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/presentations/puppet-windows-now-youre-getting-chocolatey) and a privately-hosted [Chocolatey Server](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/How-To-Host-Feed).
- Local packaging is the best you can do with chocolatey and commerical software.
  - You don't have wider distribution rights, even if it's shareware.
  - Chocolatey's most popular automatic packaging method's [license](http://realdimensions.net/licenses/chocolateypackageupdater/license.txt) requires you to purchase a license for private use.

## Getting started
### Compiling Scrivener
